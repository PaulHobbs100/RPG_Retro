# RPG_Retro
Retro style turn based RPG based on the legendary 8 bit WIZARDY  series, specifically scenario #1. In a world of high quality game engines such as Unreal and Unity, I appreciate thus will only appeal to a minority of people. However the design philisophy is to provide a totally flexible modular system that can be built on by anyone, you want better graphics, write your own to your own preferences
